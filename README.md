# 👋 Dheeraj Yerneni  
**Senior Computer Science @ UIC | Machine Learning • Data Systems • Decision Intelligence**

I build production-minded, data-driven systems that turn signals into decisions.

Focused on:
- applied machine learning
- predictive systems
- explainable risk modeling
- accessibility innovation

I care about clarity, operational impact, and real-world deployment — not just models.

## 🚀 What I’m Building Right Now

Predictive ML systems
- Fleet-level failure prediction
- Risk-scoring engines for operational decisions
- Time-based simulation datasets for training models

Accessibility tools
- Non-visual interfaces for low-vision users
- Spatial + haptic interaction design
- AI workflows beyond standard assistive tech

Rapid enterprise prototyping
- Hackathon-driven systems built end-to-end
- Dashboard + backend + ML in days, not months
